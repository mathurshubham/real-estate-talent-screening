# TypeScript Migration Progress

The project has achieved 100% TypeScript coverage. All JavaScript and JSX files have been removed or converted.

## Current Status: COMPLETED

### Milestones Reached:
- [x] Initial setup and dependency installation.
- [x] Migration of core services (`api.ts`).
- [x] Migration of shared data and utilities.
- [x] Full component migration (`tsx`).
- [x] Configuration file migration (`vite`, `tailwind`, `eslint`).
- [x] Root script migration (`check_models.ts`).
- [x] Final cleanup and verification of zero-JS status.

### Verification Results:
- Frontend build is passing with type-checking.
- Root scripts are functional via `tsx`.
- No `.js` or `.jsx` files remain in the source or root.
