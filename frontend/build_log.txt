✓ 5 modules transformed.
✗ Build failed in 660ms
error during build:
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "html-to-image" from "/home/shubham/Documents/projects/sandbox/frontend/src/App.jsx".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
